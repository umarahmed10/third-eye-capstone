"""
DASP-10 taxonomy bridge — maps each dataset/source's own native category
vocabulary into the DASP-10 buckets so per-category metrics can (optionally)
be compared across sources. This does NOT replace the native taxonomy
already stored on EvalItem/Prediction — see eval/metrics.py's
`normalize_categories` flag, off by default, which adds normalized buckets
alongside the native ones rather than overwriting them.

Plain dicts on purpose — this is a lookup table, not a system.

DASP10 categories: reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic,
unchecked_low_level_calls, denial_of_service, bad_randomness,
front_running, time_manipulation, short_addresses, other.

UNMAPPED is a separate, explicit bucket from "other": "other" is one of
DASP-10's own 10 categories (a real, in-scope technical bug that just
doesn't have its own slot — SmartBugs-Curated itself has an "other" folder).
UNMAPPED means "this isn't a DASP-10-shaped bug at all" — most commonly
Web3Bugs' S-category business-logic bugs (missing state updates, broken
business-flow assumptions, price-oracle manipulation) and out-of-scope
O-codes. That split is itself a finding, not a gap to paper over: it's
the same observation the Argus plan's own thesis rests on — most real bugs
are logic bugs a pattern taxonomy like DASP-10 was never built to hold.

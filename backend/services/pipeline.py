"""
ThirdEye orchestrator — the redesigned pipeline.

    static analysis (Slither)            ─┐
    + lightweight code features           │ ── ROUTER ── selects the RELEVANT
                                          ─┘              specialists (not all 8)
        -> model-diverse council (only the selected specialists)
        -> per-finding evidence gate (council._aggregate)
        -> adversarial arbitration (strong judge)  ── the precision gate
        -> dynamic exploit confirmation (optional)
        -> verdict: GO / NO-GO / INCONCLUSIVE

Two architectural changes vs the old "fire all 8, gate by quorum" design:
  1. STATIC-DRIVEN ROUTING (services/router.py): static + feature signals pick
     which specialists run. Pattern classes are skipped when there's no
     surface; logic classes run on heuristics (static tools can't see them).
     Fewer eager specialists on safe code -> fewer false positives -> a
     well-audited safe contract can actually reach GO.
  2. PRECISION VIA ARBITRATION, NOT QUORUM: each surviving finding is vetted by
     an independent strong judge; the verdict is recomputed from what survives.

run_full_analysis() / run_council() are composed, not modified.

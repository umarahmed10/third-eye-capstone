"""
Phase 5: evidence-anchored debate & arbitration — the precision lever for
LLM-only findings.

The council is deliberately high-recall: 8 eager single-class specialists
over-flag, and the evidence-quote gate only removes findings whose quote is
fabricated — it does NOT catch a wrong conclusion drawn about a REAL line of
code (e.g. a dos_gas specialist quoting a real `require` and calling it a DoS).
That residual false-positive class is what arbitration removes.

For each confirmed council finding we run a structured debate:
  - PROPOSER  : the original specialist's claim (already produced; not re-run).
  - RED-TEAM  : a DIFFERENT base model argues the finding is a false positive —
                that the quoted code is actually safe / the attack doesn't work.
  - JUDGE     : a strong reasoning model reads claim + rebuttal + the code and
                renders a verdict with a calibrated confidence, under an
                explicit evidence rubric (dynamic witness > static+precedent >
                LLM-only assertion). It is told to default to "not a real bug"
                when the rebuttal is not clearly defeated — precision-first.

The red-team and judge run on models DIFFERENT from the proposer's, so this is
genuine cross-model adversarial review, not the same weights agreeing with
themselves. A finding survives only if the judge upholds it.

run_full_analysis() and run_council() are untouched; this consumes a council
result and returns a refined one.

EVIDENCE RUBRIC (weight evidence, not confidence of assertion):
- A dynamic exploit witness (a PoC that runs) = decisive proof it is real.
- Static-tool evidence + a matching known-exploit precedent = strong.
- An LLM specialist's assertion alone = WEAK — it must survive the rebuttal.
Judge on the MERITS: rule REAL only if the quoted code genuinely enables the
described attack given the whole contract (no guard/modifier/version defuses
it); rule NOT-A-BUG if the rebuttal shows the code is actually safe, guarded,
unreachable, or the "bug" is a style/informational nit. Do not rubber-stamp,

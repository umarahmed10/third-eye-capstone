          ThirdEye is built from four parts that each had to work for any number
          on this site to mean anything: a corpus, an analysis pipeline, an
          evaluation harness, and a delivery path. Each member owns one
          end-to-end and carries a quarter of the evaluation.

      <Section title="How the split was decided">
        <P>
          Four subsystems, assigned so that no member's work depends on another
          member finishing first. The corpus could be built while the council
          was being written; the evaluation harness could be tested against a
          stub while the delivery path was in progress.
        </P>
        <Caveat title="Why this page does not use commit counts">
          Git attributes commits to whoever pushed them, and most of this
          repository was pushed from one machine. Corpus curation, prompt
          design, failure analysis and the statistical work largely do not
          arrive as commits under their author's name, so a contributor graph
          would misrepresent the split rather than evidence it.
        </Caveat>
        <P>
          Author order on the paper remains a separate question from workload
          and is not settled by this page.

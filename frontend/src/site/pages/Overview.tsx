        <Caveat title="We lead with the bad number on purpose">
          A 45.9% false-alarm rate means roughly one in two clean contracts gets
          flagged. ThirdEye is a cheap local filter that runs before a human
          looks — not a replacement for an audit. Every finding ships with the
          line of code it rests on precisely so a wrong one takes seconds to
          dismiss.
